            <p>Hi! my name is Tom Bradley. I'm a tattoo artist based in the town I grew up in, Bournemouth on the beautiful south coast of the UK.  I have been tattooing for nearly a decade now, gaining extensive knowledge of the craft from everyone I have had the pleasure to work alongside. </p>

            <p>A lot of people ask me what my 'style' is. And honestly, I don't think I could tell you, but I think it shows in whichever category of tattoo I set my hand to. I Love to tattoo! Whether it be small or large, colour or black and grey, ornamental, new school, neo-traditional, script or abstract and chaotic. All genres, anything that gets my mind working and my heart happy.</p>
            <p>My main goal is to make you, my client, happy. All tattoos are unique and cherished by the people wearing them, and to do this for you is an honour. I have always loved to draw for myself and friends. I would draw on myself and my notebooks constantly. Tattooing has been a natural and organic evolution of my life and the only career I have enjoyed and striven to master.</p>
            <p>Here on this website you will find an array of different tattoos I have created and applied, showcasing what I feel are my best and favourite styles to do. I customise each and every piece I do, and never repeat them, this ensures my clients have something unique, for them and them alone.</p>   
            <p>So take a gander, and if you see something that sparks you, feel free to send me an email with your ideas. I can't wait to hear them and work with you to make a tattoo you will love forever.</p>
